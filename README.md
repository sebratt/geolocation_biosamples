# geolocation_biosamples
Project on the "Global Supply Chain of Scientific Datasets". We scrape GenBank dataset IDs from Biosample and compare the paper authors' location and sample location to analyze the alignment of author and sample location. We analyze the extent that sample location can predict future coauthors to quantify if sample location matters to collab.
